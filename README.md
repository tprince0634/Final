The final keyword in Java is a non-access modifier used to apply restrictions on classes, methods, and variables. A final variableâ€™s value cannot be changed once assigned, a final method cannot be overridden by subclasses, and a final class cannot be inherited. This project demonstrates these three uses through simple Java examples, helping learners understand how final improves code stability, prevents unintended modifications, and supports immutability in object-oriented programming.
